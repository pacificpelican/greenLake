readme for [Green Lake wre5he3os1ot theme](http://djmcloud.danieljmckeown.com/greenlake/wre5he3os1ot/) by [Dan McKeown](http://danmckeown.info):

Green Lake theme is the starter theme for some projects created by [Love Birds Consulting](http://lovebirdsconsulting.com).

This is the wre5he3os1ot fork of Green Lake.  (It is slightly more styled via Foundation than Green Lake 0.2.4, the version it forked from.)

The layout for this theme is very simple, but can be enhanced easily.  For example the sidebar is below the content but can easily be made a responsive right sidebar by using the Foundation 5 grid system.

It runs on [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) and utilizes the Automattic starter theme _s (aka [Underscores](http://underscores.me)) and the Zurb front-end library [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

It was started in January 2015, forked in February 2015 and more information is available in the [style.css](style.css) file.
